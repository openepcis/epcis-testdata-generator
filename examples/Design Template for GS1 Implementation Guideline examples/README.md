# Design template based on GS1 EPCIS implementations guideline scenarios

The GS1 EPCIS standard implementation guideline (https://ref.gs1.org/guidelines/epcis-cbv/2.0.0/) offers a comprehensive set of examples that showcase different supply chain system scenarios within the EPCIS standard. Our aim is to showcase the 
ease with which these scenarios or any other desired scenarios, can be replicated using the OpenEPCIS Test Data Generator. Also, if necessary, we can generate a large volume of EPCIS events that can be utilized across diverse scenarios.

This folder comprises a range of designs for the OpenEPCIS Test Data Generator, which can be seamlessly imported into the application by executing the following:

```link
https://test-data-generator.openepcis.io/ui/DesignTestData/?url={url}
```

In the above provided link replace the `{url}` with the actual URL of the design template. Kindly note that when providing the URL, ensure that it is the raw GitHub link for accurate functionality.
Following is the example for the demonstration purpose:

```link
https://test-data-generator.openepcis.io/ui/DesignTestData/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openepcis/epcis-testdata-generator/main/examples/design%20test%20data%20ui/Exported%20Design.json
```

Each of the example file name contains the section/table number which corresponds to respective section/table within the GS1 EPCIS standard implementation guideline (https://ref.gs1.org/guidelines/epcis-cbv/2.0.0/).
